Code sample of CF Development

Coding problem:
Build a web based pizza ordering system for the Pizza Company. The Pizza Company needs a proof-of-concept application to convince family share-holders that moving to the internet is the right thing to do to improve their business. The completed project will be presented to the board of directors for the Pizza Company and if accepted, will be used as a launch pad for a more robust application.

Requirements:
- Pizza orders are for pick-up only.
- Users should be presented with a menu describing the pizza selections, available toppings, and pricing
- Users should be presented instructions on how to order a pizza
- Users should be able to enter a quantity of each pizza to order.
- There is only one size pizza: 16" in diameter.
- There are no beverages or side dishes. Only pizza.
- Users can add one or more toppings to each pizza but can only add one of each type of extra topping. For example, users can only add one amount of extra chicken.
- Store orders in an XML file for later reporting. A reporting application would be built in a future version but is not required now.
- Final check-out page should include a reference number, a recap of the order, and a total price including 7% sales tax
- Payment will not be handled here but will be expected at time of pick-up. 
- Users who complete pizza order should be told to pick up their pizza within 30 minutes of order completion time or their order is free
